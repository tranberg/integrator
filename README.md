Integrator
==========
Monte Carlo integrator based on the MISER algorithm. Possibility of choosing
between a plain integration or using stratified sampling.

This is a very old script I wrote as a part of a course on numerical methods in
the spring of 2011. I put it here because of a blog post i wrote: https://tberg.dk/post/solved-an-interesting-integral/.
